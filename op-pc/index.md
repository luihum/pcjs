This computer is a experiment to make a pretty OP computer. It currrently has:

   * CPU: 80386 @ 4MHz
   * RAM: 32MiB
   * HDD: 62MiB
   * 2 floppy drives
   * 1 CD-ROM drive
   * mouse
   * VGA 
   * 2 serial ports
   * 1 parallel port
   * a debugger
   
  Please note that mouse emulation is a bit slow.
  Also, if your computer can emulate close enough to the target speed, you can overclock the machine by clicking on the speed button.
